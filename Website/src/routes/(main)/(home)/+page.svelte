    <p>
      Dawnshard is attempting to reimplement the server infrastructure of Dragalia Lost. It aims to
      do so in a vanilla fashion, i.e. with limited changes to the original mechanics of the game.
      Though not all features are yet implemented, the game is in a playable state and it is
      possible to progress largely as normal.

      <Typography typography="h2">How to play</Typography>
      <p>
        Setting up access to the server involves configuring a modified version of the original
        Dragalia Lost app to connect to this server at{' '}
        <a class="link" href="https://dawnshard.co.uk">https://dawnshard.co.uk</a>. It is possible
        to do so on both Android and iOS without jail-breaking or rooting your device. It is also
        possible to do this on an Android emulator, even though the original game could not be
        played on emulators. If you encounter any issues during the set-up process, consider joining
        the{' '}

    <Typography typography="h2">Frequently asked questions</Typography>
    <div>
      <Typography typography="h3"
        >Can I link an account to save my progress across devices?</Typography>
      <p>
        Yes, if you follow the prompts to link an account in-game, you will be taken to the <a
          class="link"
          href="https://baas.lukefz.xyz">BaaS website</a
        >. This is a replacement for the Nintendo account linking system. If you create a new
        account and link it to your game&apos;s account, you will be able to access your progress
        from another device linked to the same account.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <Typography typography="h3">Do I have to start over?</Typography>
      <p>
        It is no longer possible to recover your progress from the original servers. However, you
        can import a save using the account linking system. You can upload a JSON file after logging
        into the BaaS with save data to be applied to the server. You can use a preset save file,
        such as this{' '}
